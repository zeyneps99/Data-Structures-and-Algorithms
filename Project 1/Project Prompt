encapsulation, polymorphism and access control of java methods. The project is about animals. There
are many species in animal kingdom with many common behaviors as well as their different properties.
In this assignment you are required to implement some of the parts of the provided files to complete
it. The code has comments about the assigment. Majority of what you need to do is actually in these
comments so make sure you read them carefully.
The descriptions for the provided files are below. Bold ones are the ones you need to modify and
they are placed under the code folder, with the rest under given.
