This assignment is designed to assess your understanding of Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues
and your implementation abilities. This assignment requires you to implement the Double Ended Queue-Deque data structure. Deque, which is pronounced as “deck”, is a generalization of the queue data
structure that supports inserting and removing elements from either the front or the back of the data
structure. The assignment will have two phases; (1) implementation of the data structures and (2)
application of the data structures.
